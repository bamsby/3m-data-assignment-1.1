## Business Question
How can game developers and publishers optimize their strategy to maximize global sales by understanding the performance of different game genres, platforms, and publishers?

*To answer the above question, use the following SQL queries to explore the dataset and address the following questions:*

Which genres contribute the most to global sales?

SQL:
```sql
SELECT Genre, SUM(Global_Sales)
FROM Game
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY SUM(Global_Sales) DESC;
```
Findings:
```findings
Action	1751.1799999999691
Sports	1330.929999999988
Shooter	1037.3699999999901
Role-Playing	927.3699999999941
Platform	831.3699999999974
```
Which platforms generate the highest global sales?

SQL:
```sql
SELECT
  Platform,
  SUM(Global_Sales) AS total_global_sales
FROM main.Game
GROUP BY Platform
ORDER BY total_global_sales DESC;
```
Findings:
```findings

```
Which publishers are the most successful in terms of global sales?

SQL:
```sql
select sum(global_sales), publisher
from vgsales.game_data 
group by publisher  
order by 1 desc;
```
Findings:
```findings
